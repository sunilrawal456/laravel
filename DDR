session and cookie

Php.ini ->   The php.ini file is a core configuration file for PHP itself, and its use in a Laravel application is not unique to Laravel but rather a fundamental aspect of how PHP applications operate.

Rate limit of api

API rate limiting is a mechanism used to control the number of requests a client (or user) can make to an API within a specified time period.

60/minute

Note -> Throtile is supported in laravel  for API rate limit.

csrf : A CSRF token is a unique, secret, and unpredictable value generated by a server to prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.


Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is a type of web security attack where a malicious attacker tricks a user's browser into making an unauthorized, state-changing request on a web application where the user is currently authenticated. 



Difference between include and require

require-> will produce a fatal error (E_COMPILE_ERROR) and stop the script.
include-> will only produce a warning (E_WARNING) and the script will continue.


require_once: If the specified file is not found, require_once will issue a fatal error (E_COMPILE_ERROR) and halt the script's execution immediately.
include_once: If the specified file is not found, include_once will issue a warning (E_WARNING), but the script will continue execution.


An error in programming, often referred to as a "bug," is a flaw or mistake in a computer program that prevents it from functioning as intended or producing the inccorrect output

Type of error in php

Authentication determines identity of user while authorization determines  what permission are granted to  that particular user.

********************Interview question*********************************

1)Diffrence between  first() and get()

first() Method:   Retrieves a single record from the database.
get() Method:     Retrieves a collection of records from the database.

2)Difference between get() and all()
all()    is a convenient shortcut for fetching all records of a model when no specific filtering or ordering is required beforehand.
get()    is used when you need to build a more complex query with conditions, ordering, or specific column selections before retrieving the results.

3)env file use 
 An .env file is a simple text file used to store environment variables, such as API keys, database credentials, and other application-specific settings, in a key-value format.

4)softdelete

5)user and order table relationship


6)service provider 
7)session and cookie
8)csrf token
9)isset(),is_null() empty()

isset() checks for existence and non-NULL value.
is_null() specifically checks for the NULL value.
empty() checks for a range of "empty" or "false" values, including NULL.


10)Que and job difference



11)migration up and down method
12)what is migration

13)what is MVC
MVC Framework Introduction  (Model-View-Controller) is a popular software design pattern that separates an application into three interconnected components: the Model (data and business logic), the View (user interface), and the Controller (handles user input and application flow).


14)route.php and api.php


web.php	                                                                api.php
Purpose	         For routes that serve web pages (views)	For routes that serve API endpoints (JSON)
Middleware               web middleware group is applied             api middleware group is applied
Session & Cookies	 Supports sessions, cookies, CSRF protection	Stateless: no session or CSRF by default
Authentication	         Typically uses session-based auth	        Typically uses token-based auth (like Passport, Sanctum)
Default Response Format  Returns HTML pages	                        Returns JSON responses



15)group by having,where user
The GROUP BY statement groups rows that have the same values into summary rows.


SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country
FROM Customers
GROUP BY Country;


SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country
FROM Customers
GROUP BY Country
ORDER BY COUNT(CustomerID) DESC;





The HAVING clause was added to SQL because the WHERE keyword cannot be used with aggregate functions.8

SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country
FROM Customers
GROUP BY Country
HAVING COUNT(CustomerID) > 5;



The WHERE clause is used to filter records.
It is used to extract only those records that fulfill a specified condition.


SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country='Mexico';



16)Middleware

Middleware in Laravel acts as a bridge between a request and a response. For example, if we want to redirect different types of users to their respective dashboards, or control access to routes and sidebar menus based on their permissions, we can use middleware.

Que & jobs
A job is a specific task to be executed, like sending an email,
Queue is a waiting list that holds these jobs until a worker is available to process them.


 




A SQL engine, also known as a SQL database engine or database engine, is the core software component within a Database Management System (DBMS) responsible for processing and managing data in a relational database.

How to prevent sql injection

a)Web Application Firewalls
b)Keep Software Up to Date
c)Use Stored Procedures -> A stored procedure is a precompiled set of SQL statements that are stored and executed on the database server.
d)Use Prepared Statements




In PHP, we have the following loop types:

while - loops through a block of code as long as the specified condition is true
do...while - loops through a block of code once, and then repeats the loop as long as the specified condition is true
for - loops through a block of code a specified number of times
foreach - loops through a block of code for each element in an array




Cookies are client-side files that are stored on a local computer.
Sessions are server-side files  that are stored on server.







Interview question

1)Abstract class
An abstract class is a restricted class in object-oriented programming that serves as a blueprint for other classes and cannot be instantiated directly.


2)Encapsulation
Wrapping data and its member functions into a single entity is known as encapsulation. 

3)static class

These are regular PHP classes where all properties and methods are declared as static using the static keyword.




7)Primary key, Unique Key, Foreign Key
A primary key is used to uniquely identify each record in a database table, preventing duplicate entries and ensuring data integrity.
 
A foreign key is a column or a set of columns in one table that establishes a link to the primary key of another table, enforcing referential integrity between the two tables.

A unique key is a column or a set of columns in a database table that enforces uniqueness, ensuring that no two rows have the same value(s) in those columns, except for NULL values.


8)Global variables
Some predefined variables in PHP are "superglobals", which means that they are always accessible, regardless of scope.

$_SERVER
$_REQUEST
$_POST
$_GET
$_FILES
$_COOKIE
$_SESSION

9)Middleware 10 or 11 define 

10)What is guard in Laravel
In Laravel, a guard is simply the way Laravel decides how to authenticate a user.

A guard checks who you are before letting you in.
Different gates can have different guards


11)Access Modifiers


In object-oriented programming, access specifiers are also known as access modifiers. These specifiers control how and where the properties or methods of a class can be accessed, either from inside the class, from a subclass, or from outside the class. PHP supports three primary access specifiers:

public
protected
private


12)Relationship

Relationships in Laravel are a way to define relations between different models in the applications.

15)PUT and PATCH Difference
           PUT                                                           PATCH
Used to update or replace an entire resource.                        Used to apply partial modifications to a resource.
Requires the client to send the complete resource representation.    Requires only the changes (delta) to be sent, not the entire resource.	
Contains the full resource representation                            Contains only the fields or data to be updated.





16)What is namespace
Namespaces help you logically group related classes, making your codebase easier to navigate and maintain.
